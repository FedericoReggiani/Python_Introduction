# Introduction to Python 

I made this notebook for my _introduction to Python course_ in _university of Milano-Bicocca_ as a part of _Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics_.
This course is created to introduce Python to students who have no knowledge of Python or programming in general.

About this course

This introduction course, tends to give you an overview of Python programming language and its general structure as in the future modules of Master like web scrapping, Machine learning and text mining Python will be used as the principal programming language. Please note that due to the vast range of arguments/tools related to Python language we won't/can't cover them all here as this course designed to help you not to become a Python programmers but to learn its basics and enable you to expand your data science skills using it as a modern programming language.
## Structure

Our goal here is not to provide a deep insight into Python and act as an official reference since you can easily can access hundreds of online sources to learn about each and every detail of Python. Given the wide range of students' backgrounds, there is no assumption about prior knowledge about programming or data analysis. We've tried to provide you with simple examples which give you a clear understanding of functionality of different tools. There are also parts called YOUR TURN which ask you to put into practice what you have learned during the lesson. These parts are accompanied by three different symbols which show the difficulty of the exercise:

- _EASY_: You're expected to solve it by yourself. (max 2 min)

- _So-So_: In case you find it hard to solve, try to ask your friend's opinion. (max 5 min)

- _HARD_: If you're not comfortable with it, leave it alone! once in home, try to attack it again!

For the questions that you should write code, you'll find a code block with a Python in it! just remove it and insert your answer instead.

While major parts of codes are self-explanatory, there are ones that need a more detailed explanation. These parts are indicated by an owl sign!
